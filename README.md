## Purpose

I intend to write a [Single-page Application][SPA] to display the title, image
and alternative text of the [**xkcd**][xkcd] comic specified by a parameter. It
must provide navigation buttons to go to the previous and next comic so you can
read the comics chronologically one after another.


### Why not use the xkcd web site?

* You need to put the mouse over the image to read the alternative text and wait
  (precious seconds wasted here). Loads more stuff than what you need just to
* read the comic.


### There are a lot of xkcd viewers out there. Why one more?

I want to apply a couple of things I've learned about web apps development. I
also want to find out what else I still don't know.
